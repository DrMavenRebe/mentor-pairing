### Pairing is Caring

This application facilitates the coordination of mentoring appointments. Anyone
who is willing to mentor can expose their availability. Anyone who wants some
mentoring can request to create an appointment with an available mentor. We
encourage people to use the time to pair program together.

#### UI Development

Pairing Is Caring uses Compass to compile Sass to CSS. To edit the styles and
have Compass automatically watch for your changes, run:

	bundle exec compass watch
